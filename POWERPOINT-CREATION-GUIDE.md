```
500mb Features (Nov 5, 2025):
Height Pattern:
• Zonal (west-to-east) flow
• Embedded shortwave trough over Great Lakes
• Ridge downstream over Atlantic
• Progressive pattern = systems moving quickly

Impact on Concord:
• Northwest flow aloft
• Shortwave approaching Wed/Thu
• Limited upper-level support currently
• Next system brings vorticity advection
```

**What to Say:**
"At the 500 millibar level, roughly 18,000 feet, we see a progressive zonal flow pattern. An embedded shortwave trough is visible over the Great Lakes region and will approach our area Wednesday night. This trough will provide the upper-level support for our next precipitation event."

**Layout:** Title + large image + analysis box

**Title:** Upper-Air Analysis - 300mb Jet Stream

**Content:**
1. **Insert screenshot:** `300mb-jet.png`
2. **Add analysis box:**

```
Jet Stream Analysis (Nov 5, 2025):
Position: From Pacific Northwest → Great Lakes →
         Maritime Canada
Speed: 100-120 knots in jet core
Type: Polar jet in progressive pattern

Dynamic Support:
• Jet currently positioned north of region
• Clipper track along jet stream axis
• Weak jet streaks embedded in flow
• Modest upper-level divergence with systems

Key Point: Progressive pattern = frequent but weak systems
```

**What to Say:**
"The 300mb analysis shows the polar jet stream in a progressive pattern from the Pacific Northwest through the Great Lakes to Maritime Canada. Wind speeds in the jet core are 100-120 knots. This pattern supports frequent but generally weak clipper systems moving through our region every 2-3 days."

### SLIDE 12: Sounding Analysis

**Layout:** Title + large sounding image + interpretation

**Title:** Local Focus - Atmospheric Sounding (GYX)

**Content:**
1. **Insert screenshot:** `sounding.png` (from Gray, ME 12Z)
2. **Add interpretation box:**

```
Sounding Analysis - Gray, ME (12Z Nov 5):

Thermodynamics:
• CAPE: Near zero (stable cold-season air mass)
• CIN: N/A
• Lifted Index: Positive (stable)
• Moisture: Dry throughout column

Wind Profile:
• Surface: NW 15-25 mph
• 850mb: NW 40-50 knots (strong!)
• 500mb: W-NW 50-60 knots
• 300mb: W-NW 100-110 knots (jet level)

Key Findings:
✓ Strong winds throughout column
✓ Well-mixed profile = high mixing heights
✓ Cold air advection (winds backing with height)
✓ No convective threat (stable)
✓ Gusty surface winds from mixing
```

**What to Say:**
"The morning sounding from Gray, Maine shows a well-mixed atmosphere with strong winds throughout the entire column. Notice the wind profile - northwest winds increase from 15-25 mph at the surface to over 100 knots at jet level. This strong vertical wind profile, combined with high mixing heights around 4000-5000 feet, allows those strong winds aloft to mix down to the surface, creating our gusty conditions."

└───────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────────┴────────────┘

FORECAST REASONING:

Temperature:
Blending GFS and NAM with slight cool bias. Highs 48-52°F,
near to slightly below normal. Warmest Friday ahead of next
system, coolest Monday post-frontal. Air mass changes with
each frontal passage drive day-to-day variability.

Winds:
Gustiest Sunday (22 mph) with approaching system and tight
pressure gradient. 850mb winds 40-50 kt mix to surface.
Northwest winds post-frontal, southwest pre-frontal.

Precipitation:
Two events: Friday afternoon (0.20") and Sunday (0.45").
Friday: light rain with weak system. Sunday: moderate rain
with better dynamics (PVA, frontogenesis). Total: 0.7"
(above normal). Lean toward NAM for mesoscale details.

### SLIDE 19: Forecast Uncertainty

**Layout:** Title + confidence levels + uncertainty factors

**Title:** Forecast Uncertainty & Confidence

**Content:**

```
HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80%):
✓ Active pattern continues through next week
✓ Multiple precipitation events Fri & Sun
✓ General temperature trend (near to below normal)
✓ Gusty winds with systems
✓ No severe weather

MODERATE CONFIDENCE (60-80%):
≈ Exact timing of systems (±3-6 hours)
≈ Daily high/low temperatures (±3°F)
≈ Wind speeds (±5 mph)
≈ System tracks (±50-100 miles)

LOW CONFIDENCE (<60%):
? Exact QPF amounts (±30-50%)
? Mesoscale precipitation bands
? Hour-by-hour timing
? Potential for brief rain/snow mix in mountains

SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY:
1. Model Spread: GFS vs NAM differ by 20-40% on QPF
2. Track Sensitivity: 50-mile track shift = significant
   temperature/precipitation differences
3. Timing: Affects high temperature by 3-5°F
4. Mesoscale: Small-scale features not well resolved
5. Progressive Pattern: Systems move quickly =
   less time for models to refine forecast
```

### SLIDE 20: Final Discussion - Synthesis

**Layout:** Three sections clearly labeled

**Title:** Synthesis: Past → Present → Future

**Content:**

```
PAST (What Happened):
Monday night: Cold front approached from the west with
strong southerly flow ahead. Front passed overnight with
rain and gusty winds. Upper-level shortwave at 500mb
provided lift via positive vorticity advection (PVA).
System moved quickly in progressive pattern.

PRESENT (What's Happening - Nov 5):
Post-frontal northwest flow. High pressure over Great Lakes,
strong pressure gradient driving gusty WNW winds 20-30 mph.
At 500mb: northwest flow behind departing trough. Jet stream
positioned from Pacific NW through Great Lakes to Maritime
Canada in progressive pattern. Clear skies from subsidence.
Temperature near normal (54°F). Dry, stable air mass.

FUTURE (What Will Happen - Fri-Mon):
Active pattern continues with two main precipitation events:

1) Friday: Weak system brings light rain (0.20") in
afternoon/evening. Lift from isentropic processes and weak
PVA. Quick-moving clipper.

2) Sunday: Stronger system with better dynamics - 500mb
shortwave provides strong PVA, low-level jet transports
moisture, frontogenetic forcing enhances precipitation.
Moderate rain (0.45") expected. Gustiest winds (20-25 mph).

Temperature: Near to below normal. Progressive pattern =
frequent but generally moderate impacts.

Confidence: High in pattern, moderate in details.

## 💬 PRESENTATION SCRIPT SNIPPETS

### Opening (30 seconds):
"Good morning/afternoon. Today I'll be presenting a comprehensive weather analysis and forecast for Concord, New Hampshire. Following the Bosart framework, we'll examine what happened in the recent past, what's happening now, and what we can expect in the future. Let's start with the big picture..."

### Satellite Slide:
"Looking at today's GOES-16 satellite imagery, we can see clear skies over New England. This is characteristic post-frontal clearing following the cold front passage Monday night. The cloud patterns show a progressive, zonal flow pattern with the next disturbance visible approaching from the west. Notice the jet stream signature in the comma-shaped cloud pattern over [point to location]."

### 500mb Slide:
"At the 500 millibar level, which is roughly 18,000 feet above sea level, we see a progressive zonal flow pattern. An embedded shortwave trough is currently over the Great Lakes region. Ahead of this trough, we have positive vorticity advection, which provides lift and supports the development of clouds and precipitation. This shortwave will move through our area late Wednesday into Thursday, bringing our next precipitation event."

### Jet Stream Slide:
"The 300 millibar analysis shows the polar jet stream positioned from the Pacific Northwest through the Great Lakes to Maritime Canada. Wind speeds in the jet core are running 100 to 120 knots. This progressive pattern is classic for clipper systems - frequent but generally weak disturbances moving along the jet stream axis every 2 to 3 days. This explains our active pattern."

### Sounding Slide:
"The morning sounding from Gray, Maine shows some really interesting features. First, notice the wind profile - [trace with pointer] we have northwest winds increasing from 15-25 mph at the surface all the way up to over 100 knots at jet level. The atmosphere is well-mixed with high mixing heights around 4000-5000 feet. This combination allows those strong winds aloft to mix down to the surface, which is why we're experiencing gusty conditions today."

### Forecast Slide (MOST IMPORTANT):
"Based on my analysis of the GFS and NAM models, along with NBM ensemble guidance, here is my forecast for Concord Friday through Monday. [Read forecast]. For temperature, I'm forecasting highs in the upper 40s to low 50s, which is near to slightly below normal for early November. The warmest day will be Friday ahead of the next system, and the coldest will be Monday in post-frontal northwest flow.

For precipitation, I'm forecasting two main events: Friday afternoon with about two-tenths of an inch, and Sunday with about four-and-a-half tenths. The Sunday system will be stronger because of better upper-level support from a 500-millibar shortwave trough, stronger low-level moisture transport, and frontogenetic forcing along the frontal boundary. I'm leaning slightly toward the NAM model for precipitation amounts because its higher resolution better captures mesoscale precipitation bands.

For winds, the gustiest conditions will be Sunday with maximum sustained winds around 22 miles per hour as the pressure gradient tightens with the approaching low pressure system."

### Uncertainty Slide:
"Now let's talk about forecast uncertainty, which is always important to address. I have high confidence in the general pattern - that we'll see multiple systems bringing precipitation. However, I have moderate confidence in the exact timing, which could vary by 3 to 6 hours. The biggest uncertainty is in exact precipitation amounts. The GFS and NAM differ by about 20 to 40 percent on QPF, which represents the challenge of forecasting mesoscale details in a progressive pattern where systems move quickly."

### Closing:
"To synthesize everything: we've had an active pattern with Monday's frontal passage bringing gusty winds and rain. Currently, we're in post-frontal clearing with gusty northwest winds from the strong pressure gradient. Looking ahead, the active pattern will continue with two more precipitation events expected Friday and Sunday. Overall, this is a classic progressive late-fall pattern for New England with frequent but generally moderate impacts. I'm happy to take any questions."

## ❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "Why did you choose your forecast over the model guidance?"**
A: "I blended both models with a slight lean toward the NAM for precipitation amounts because its higher 12-kilometer resolution better captures mesoscale features like precipitation bands. However, I gave more weight to the GFS for system timing because the GEFS ensemble members support that solution. The NBM consensus guidance helped me calibrate the final forecast."

**Q: "What if the low tracks further south than forecast?"**
A: "Great question. If the Sunday low tracks 50 to 100 miles further south, that would put Concord more directly in the precipitation shield, potentially increasing QPF by 0.2 to 0.4 inches. It would also mean colder temperatures, possibly 3 to 5 degrees cooler, and stronger winds due to a tighter pressure gradient."

**Q: "Could there be thunderstorms?"**
A: "Thunderstorms are very unlikely. The sounding shows CAPE values near zero, which indicates a stable atmosphere. This is typical for early November when we have cold season weather patterns. The lack of instability, combined with limited low-level moisture and cold air aloft, means convection is not a concern for this forecast period."

**Q: "How confident are you in this forecast?"**
A: "I have high confidence - greater than 80 percent - in the general pattern and that we'll see precipitation Friday and Sunday. I have moderate confidence - 60 to 80 percent - in the exact timing and temperature values, meaning they could vary by 3 to 6 hours and 2 to 3 degrees. The lowest confidence is in exact precipitation amounts because the models show a spread of 30 to 50 percent, which reflects mesoscale uncertainty."

**Q: "Will there be any snow?"**
A: "Snow is unlikely at Concord's elevation of 342 feet. Temperatures will be too warm with highs in the upper 40s to low 50s. However, the higher peaks in the White Mountains, above 3000-4000 feet, could see a rain-snow mix or wet snowfall, especially with the Sunday system if colder air wraps in on the backside."

**Q: "What about the wind forecast?"**
A: "Winds will be gusty with each system. Currently we're seeing gusts to 30 mph in post-frontal northwest flow. Friday, winds will shift to the southwest ahead of the system at 15-20 mph. Sunday will be the gustiest day with winds of 22 mph and gusts potentially to 30-35 mph as the pressure gradient tightens between the approaching low and departing high. The strong 850-millibar winds of 40-50 knots will mix down to the surface."

**Q: "How does this compare to climatology?"**
A: "Temperature-wise, we're near normal. The climatological average high for early November is around 52 degrees, and we're forecasting 48-52. For precipitation, we're running above normal. The normal for this time period would be about 0.3-0.4 inches, and we're forecasting 0.7 inches, which is about double the normal amount. This reflects the active pattern."
