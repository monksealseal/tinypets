- "We see a trough positioned over [region]"
- "The trough axis extends from [A] to [B]"
- "Vorticity maxima are located [here]"
- "This upper-level pattern is providing lift for the surface low"

**Connect to Surface:**
- "This trough is directly related to our surface low position"

### Slide 11: Current METAR
**Update with actual METAR from Friday:**

**Template:**
```
METAR KCON [TIME]Z [WIND] [VIS] [SKY] [TEMP/DEWPT] [ALTIMETER] RMK...

Decoded:
- Temperature: __°F
- Dewpoint: __°F
- Wind: [DIR] at [SPD] knots, gusting [GST] knots
- Visibility: __ statute miles
- Sky Condition: [FEW/SCT/BKN/OVC]### at [HGT] feet
- Altimeter: __.__ inches
- Remarks: [Note any significant weather]
```

**What to say:**
- "Current conditions at Concord show temperature of [X] degrees"
- "Dewpoint is [X] giving us a temperature-dewpoint spread of [X] degrees"
- "This indicates [dry/moist] air"
- "Winds are from the [direction] at [speed] with gusts to [X] mph"

- Is there cold or warm air advection?

### Slide 18: WxChallenge Forecast ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

**Update this table with YOUR forecast:**

| Date | High Temp (°F) | Low Temp (°F) | Max Wind (mph) | Precip (inches) |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Friday** | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| **Saturday** | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| **Sunday** | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| **Monday** | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

**Example (from Nov 4 analysis - UPDATE FOR YOUR DATES):**

| Date | High Temp (°F) | Low Temp (°F) | Max Wind (mph) | Precip (inches) |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Friday 11/7** | 52 | 40 | 22 | 0.35 |
| **Saturday 11/8** | 48 | 31 | 18 | 0.02 |
| **Sunday 11/9** | 54 | 38 | 25 | 0.65 |
| **Monday 11/10** | 49 | 35 | 20 | 0.08 |

**Forecast Reasoning (Fill in YOUR reasoning):**

**Temperature:**
"High temperatures will range from [X] to [X] degrees, which is [above/below/near] normal for mid-November. The [warmest/coldest] day will be [day] due to [reason: warm/cold advection, frontal position, cloud cover, etc.]"

**Winds:**
"Maximum winds will occur on [day] with gusts to [X] mph as [reason: cold frontal passage, strong pressure gradient, etc.]. The [850mb/surface] pressure gradient of [X] millibars per [distance] will support winds of [X] mph at the surface."

**Precipitation:**
"Precipitation is forecast for [days] with total accumulation of [X] inches. The heaviest precipitation is expected [Friday night/Saturday/Sunday] with the passage of [frontal system/low pressure]. QPF is based on [model consensus showing X inches, omega values indicating strong lift, moisture transport of X g/kg]."

### Slide 19: Model Comparison

**GFS vs NAM - What to compare:**

**Create a comparison table:**

| Feature | GFS | NAM | Your Forecast |
|---------|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Friday System Arrival** | [Time] | [Time] | [Your choice] |
| **Friday High Temp** | [X]°F | [X]°F | [X]°F |
| **Friday QPF** | [X]" | [X]" | [X]" |
| **Sunday System Track** | [N/S of region] | [N/S of region] | [Choice] |
| **Weekend Total QPF** | [X]" | [X]" | [X]" |

**What to say:**
- "The GFS and NAM models show generally good agreement on..."
- "However, they differ in [timing/intensity/track]"
- "The GFS brings the system in around [time] while the NAM is [faster/slower] by [X] hours"
- "For QPF, the GFS shows [X] inches while the NAM is more aggressive with [X] inches"
- "I'm going with [model/blend] because [reason: ensemble support, recent model performance, physical reasoning]"

### Slide 20: Final Discussion

**Past (What Happened):**
"Over the past 48 hours, [describe: cold front passage, wind event, temperature changes]. This occurred because [dynamic reasoning: upper-level support, jet positioning, etc.]"

**Present (What's Happening Now):**
"Currently, we're seeing [describe current pattern]. This is due to [explain: post-frontal high pressure, subsidence, etc.]. The [upper/surface] pattern shows [features]."

**Future (What Will Happen):**
"Over the next 3-4 days, [describe forecast]. This will occur because [reasoning: approaching trough, jet streak positioning, moisture transport, etc.]"

**High Confidence In:**
- [List items - e.g., "General temperature trend above/below normal"]
- [e.g., "Timing of frontal passage within ±6 hours"]
- [e.g., "Total precipitation 1-2 inches"]

**Lower Confidence In:**
- [List uncertain items - e.g., "Exact QPF amounts for Sunday"]
- [e.g., "Precise location of rain/snow line"]
- [e.g., "Peak wind gust timing"]

## DYNAMICAL REASONING PHRASES TO USE

### For Upper-Level Support:
- "Positive vorticity advection ahead of the shortwave trough provides upward vertical motion"
- "The jet streak's right-exit quadrant is positioned over [region], providing upper-level divergence"
- "Strong isentropic lift as warm, moist air rides up and over the cold air mass"
- "Height falls at 500mb indicate a deepening trough"
- "The omega equation suggests strong ascent due to [vorticity advection/thermal advection]"

### For Temperature:
- "Cold air advection behind the front will drop temperatures below normal"
- "Warm air advection ahead of the front will boost temperatures"
- "Strong subsidence behind the high pressure will create a temperature inversion"
- "Diabatic cooling from evaporation will limit daytime heating"
- "Clear skies overnight will allow strong radiational cooling"

### For Precipitation:
- "Isentropic lift along the warm front will produce steady light to moderate rain"
- "Frontogenetic forcing will enhance precipitation rates along the frontal boundary"
- "Low-level jet at 850mb transporting [X] g/kg of moisture"
- "Lift mechanism includes: [frontal forcing/isentropic lift/orographic enhancement/jet dynamics]"
- "The NAM shows stronger QPF due to better resolution of mesoscale precipitation bands"

### For Winds:
- "Tight pressure gradient with [X] millibars over [distance] will support winds of [Y] mph"
- "Strong winds aloft at 850mb ([X] knots) will mix down to the surface with high mixing heights"
- "Ageostrophic winds in the exit region of the jet streak will enhance surface winds"

## COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "Why did you choose [GFS/NAM] over the other model?"**
A: "I weighted the [chosen model] more heavily because [1] the ensemble members support this solution, [2] recent verification shows better performance, and [3] it makes physical sense given the synoptic pattern."

**Q: "What if the low tracks 50 miles further south?"**
A: "A southern track would mean [colder temperatures/less precipitation/snow instead of rain] because [Concord would be in the cold sector/less moisture transport/etc.]"

**Q: "How confident are you in this forecast?"**
A: "I have high confidence in the general pattern - [X]. However, there's lower confidence in [Y] because [model spread/ensemble uncertainty/mesoscale details]."

**Q: "Could we see thunderstorms?"**
A: "Thunderstorms are [unlikely/possible] because [CAPE values are X/shear is Y/instability is Z]."

**Q: "What about snow?"**
A: "[Snow is not expected at this time/Snow is possible in higher elevations] because [temperatures/elevation/cold air depth]."
