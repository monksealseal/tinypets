- **Frontal passage: Monday night (Nov 3-4)**

### Present (What's Happening?) - November 4, 2025

#### A. Surface Analysis

**Current Surface Features:**
- **Post-frontal high pressure** building from the northwest
- Cold front now offshore, continuing to push east
- Strong pressure gradient between departing low and building high
- **Isobars tightly packed** = strong winds

**Location of Features Relative to Concord:**
- High pressure center: Central Canada/Great Lakes region
- Low pressure: Departing into Atlantic Canada
- Concord: In the post-frontal northwest flow

**Wind Flow:**
- Northwest winds 15-25 mph sustained
- Gusts: 30-45 mph (especially exposed areas, lee side of mountains)
- **Small Craft Advisory** coastal waters (1 PM - 1 AM EST)
- **Gale Warning** coastal waters (1 AM - 9 PM EST Tuesday)

**Current Weather:**
- Mostly sunny skies (cold advection, subsidence behind front)
- Dry conditions
- Wind-driven lake mixing
- Mixing heights: ~4000 ft

#### B. Satellite Imagery Interpretation

**Large-Scale Features:**
- Comma-shaped cloud pattern associated with departing low pressure
- Clear skies over New England behind cold front
- Jet stream positioned from Great Lakes through Maritime Canada
- Next weather system visible approaching Pacific Northwest

**Cloud Patterns:**
- Post-frontal clearing evident across New England
- Stratocumulus clouds over Atlantic with departing system
- High-level cirrus beginning to stream in from west (next system)

#### C. Radar Imagery

**Precipitation:**
- No significant precipitation over New England
- Scattered rain showers with departing system offshore
- Light precipitation associated with next system over Great Lakes region
- Mountain snow showers possible in White Mountains with upslope NW flow

**Storm Movement:**

## 2. UPPER-AIR ANALYSIS (20 points)

### 500 mb Analysis

**Pattern Description:**
- **Amplifying pattern developing**
- Deep trough approaching Pacific Northwest/West Coast
- Ridge building over Intermountain West
- Shortwave trough embedded in flow affecting Great Lakes/Northeast
- Longwave trough position: Eastern North America

**Key Features:**
- **Heights:** Negative height anomalies across eastern US
- **Vorticity Maximum:** Associated with current system, now departing
- **Next Shortwave:** Approaching from Great Lakes, will affect region Wednesday
- **Temperature Advection:** Cold air advection (CAA) at 500mb behind current system

**Trough/Ridge Positions:**
- Trough axis: Currently along/east of Appalachians
- Next trough: Great Lakes region, moving east
- Ridge: Building behind front over central Canada

**Impact on Surface Weather:**
- Upper-level support for surface low now diminishing (departing)
- Positive vorticity advection (PVA) shifting east of region
- Cold air aloft supporting convective instability = upslope snow showers
- Next system: PVA will increase Wednesday as shortwave approaches

### 300 mb / Jet Stream Analysis

**Jet Stream Position:**
- **Polar jet** positioned from Pacific Northwest through Great Lakes to Maritime Canada
- Jet streak currently over/near New England
- **Jet axis:** Approximately along 45°N latitude
- **Wind speeds:** 100-120 knots in jet core

**Jet Streak Analysis:**
- **Current position:** Right exit region over/downstream of New England
- This supports: Upper-level divergence, BUT system already departing
- **850 mb winds:** 50 knots = strong low-level winds mixing to surface

**Four-Quadrant Model (for departing jet streak):**
- Right Entrance: Sinking (upstream of New England)
- Left Exit: Rising (over Atlantic with departing low)
- Right Exit: Rising (New England region - but weakening influence)
- Left Entrance: Sinking (to our west)

**Dynamic Support:**
- Current jet position provided lift for Monday's system
- Jet moving offshore with system = decreasing upper support
- Next jet streak approaches Wednesday with next system

**Connection to Surface Features:**
- Jet-level divergence helped deepen Monday's surface low
- Strong winds aloft (50kt at 850mb) mixing down = gusty surface winds
- Jet positioning consistent with frontal zone location

- **CIN:** N/A (no convective threat)
- **Lifted Index:** Positive (stable)
- **Moisture:** Dry air mass post-frontal, RH 40-60%
- **Inversions:** Possible weak subsidence inversion 700-600 mb

**Wind Profile:**
- **Surface:** NW 15-25 mph
- **850 mb:** NW 50 knots (strong!)
- **700 mb:** W-NW 40-50 knots
- **500 mb:** W-NW 60-70 knots
- **300 mb:** WNW 100-120 knots (jet level)

**Thermal Advection:**

### Day-by-Day Forecast Discussion

#### **FRIDAY, November 7, 2025**

**Synoptic Setup:**
- Another frontal system approaching
- Low pressure tracking through Great Lakes
- Warm front lifts north, cold front follows

**GFS Solution:**
- Warm front passes early Friday
- Rain develops Friday afternoon/evening
- Cold front Friday night
- QPF: 0.25-0.50"

**NAM Solution:**

- Low: 40°F (range 36-44°F)
- PoP: 70%
- QPF: 0.35" (median)

**Forecast Reasoning:**
- Southerly flow ahead of warm front = milder temps Friday
- Overcast skies limit warming
- Rain likely Friday afternoon through Friday night
- Best model agreement: timing and general QPF amounts

### WxChallenge Format Forecast

| **Day** | **High (°F)** | **Low (°F)** | **Max Wind (mph)** | **Precip (in)** |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Friday 11/7** | 52 | 40 | 22 | 0.35 |
| **Saturday 11/8** | 48 | 31 | 18 | 0.02 |
| **Sunday 11/9** | 54 | 38 | 25 | 0.65 |
| **Monday 11/10** | 49 | 35 | 20 | 0.08 |

### Forecast Uncertainty & Confidence

**HIGH CONFIDENCE:**
- Active pattern continuing through the weekend
- Multiple precipitation events
- General temperature trends (below to near normal)
- Windy conditions at times

**MODERATE CONFIDENCE:**
- Exact timing of precipitation events (±3-6 hours)
- QPF amounts (models show range 0.3-1.0" for Sunday)
- Temperatures within 3-5°F of forecast
- Peak wind gusts timing

**LOW CONFIDENCE:**
- Mesoscale details (heavy rain bands, t-storm potential)
- Exact high/low temperatures (cloud cover dependent)
- Sunday system track (50-100 mile uncertainty)

**Sources of Uncertainty:**
1. **Track Uncertainty:** Sunday's low could track 100 miles further south = big temp/precip differences
2. **Timing Uncertainty:** Front timing affects high temps significantly
3. **Model Spread:** GFS vs NAM differ by 6 hours on Sunday system
4. **QPF Uncertainty:** Models range 0.5-0.9" = 80% spread
5. **Temperature Uncertainty:** Cloud cover timing = 5-7°F temp range

### Ensemble Guidance

**GEFS (GFS Ensemble):**
- Mean solution similar to deterministic GFS
- Spread indicates timing uncertainty Sunday
- 70% members show 0.50-1.00" QPF Friday-Monday
- Temperature spread: ±4°F

**Key Insight:**
- Pattern is well-established (high confidence big picture)
- Details remain uncertain (timing, amounts)
- Multiple model runs suggest similar outcomes = increasing confidence

## 5. DYNAMICAL REASONING & SYNTHESIS

### Why This Pattern?

**Jet Stream Configuration:**
- Amplifying pattern with western trough, eastern ridge evolving
- Progressive jet stream = systems moving through every 2-3 days
- Polar vortex disruption early November = increased meridional flow
- Storm track positioned through Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Valley

**Upper-Level Support:**
- 500mb shortwave troughs providing lift
- Jet streaks providing upper-level divergence
- Good coupling between upper and surface features

**Surface Response:**
- Low pressure systems tracking through Great Lakes region
- Fronts sweeping through New England
- Post-frontal high pressure briefly builds between systems

### Recent Past → Present → Future

**PAST (What Happened?):**
- Cold front approached Monday from Quebec
- Strong southerly flow Monday afternoon (warm advection)
- Frontal passage Monday night
- Upper-level shortwave provided lift

**PRESENT (What's Happening - Nov 4):**
- Post-frontal northwest flow
- Strong winds aloft (850mb: 50kt) mixing to surface
- Gusty conditions: 30-45 mph
- High pressure building from northwest
- Dry, stable air mass
- Clear skies (subsidence)

**FUTURE (What Will Happen?):**
- Active pattern continues
- Next system Wednesday brings rain/mix
- Friday-Sunday: Another system with moderate rainfall
- Pattern: Progressive fronts every 2-3 days
- Temperature: Near to below normal
- Precipitation: Above normal for period

### Key Forecast Points

1. **Active Pattern Established:** Multiple systems through next week
2. **Temperature Trend:** Near normal now, trending below normal
3. **Precipitation:** Multiple rain events, accumulating 1-2" total
4. **Wind:** Gusty at times with frontal passages
5. **Pattern Duration:** Active through at least November 10-12
